## [Let dp[i][j] be the minimum cost if we cut on the stick from A[i] to A[j].](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/discuss/780901/C%2B%2B-bottom-up-dp-with-explanation)

  In the [following example](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/discuss/780880/DP-with-picture-(Burst-Balloons)), you can see the first cut at points ```1 (or 4)``` results in total cost of ```13 (5 + 0 + 8)```. If we first cut at point ```2 (or 3)```, the cost will be ```12 (5 + 2 + 5)```.
