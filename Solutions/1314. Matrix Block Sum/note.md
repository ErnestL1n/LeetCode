  1. rangeSum[i + 1][j + 1] corresponds to cell (i, j);
  2. rangeSum[0][j] and rangeSum[i][0] are all dummy values, which are used for the convenience of computation of DP state transmission formula.
  To calculate rangeSum, the ideas are as below

+-----+-+-------+     +--------+-----+     +-----+---------+     +-----+--------+
|     | |       |     |        |     |     |     |         |     |     |        |
|     | |       |     |        |     |     |     |         |     |     |        |
+-----+-+       |     +--------+     |     |     |         |     +-----+        |
|     | |       |  =  |              |  +  |     |         |  -  |              | + mat[i][j]
+-----+-+       |     |              |     +-----+         |     |              |
|               |     |              |     |               |     |              |
|               |     |              |     |               |     |              |
+---------------+     +--------------+     +---------------+     +--------------+
rangeSum[i+1][j+1] =  rangeSum[i][j+1] + rangeSum[i+1][j]    -   rangeSum[i][j]   + mat[i][j]

So, we use the same idea to find the specific block's sum

|   (r1,c1)     |   |         |    |   |   |           |   |         |    |   |   |          |

|   |      |    | = |         |    | - |   |           | - |      (r1,c2) | + |   (r1,c1)    |
|   |      |    |   |         |    |   |   |           |   |              |   |              |
|   +------+    |   +---------+    |   +---+           |   |              |   |              |
|        (r2,c2)|   |       (r2,c2)|   |   (r2,c1)     |   |              |   |              |
+---------------+   +--------------+   +---------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
